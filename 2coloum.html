                    <p>The Russian North is a place for true travelers. Traditionally, it includes the territories of the Arkhangelsk, Murmansk and Vologda regions, Karelia and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. This is a kingdom of pristine nature and harsh climate. Here you can not only see the northern lights and admire the landscapes of fantastic beauty, but also fully know yourself — to put your own strength into practice and show character. The concept of "active tourism" is the best fit for these places.</p>
                    <p>In ancient times, this vast territory was called the Swamp. The lands were rich in furs, game and fish. Since the climate did not allow for full farming, there were few peasants, and therefore there was almost no serfdom. But there was a lot of freedom. At various times, the territory was inhabited by Finno-Ugric tribes, Chud, Pomors. In the Middle Ages, the first monasteries appeared.</p>

                    <div class="viborg_text">
                        <p>Vyborg is a medieval Russian city that has managed to visit both Swedish and Finnish. It paradoxically combines crooked medieval streets and modern embankments, an Orthodox cathedral and a Lutheran church, the oldest residential building in Russia and a Swedish fortress, a Viking rook and a hotel in the form of a cruise liner.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px ;">The one—day route is as follows: Red Square — Cathedral Square — Market Square — Progonnaya Street — Fortress Street — Castle Island — Monrepos Park - Embankment.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px ;">Vyborg has been known since 1293, when the Swedes built the castle of the same name here. It received the status of a city in 1403, during the Northern War it was an important Swedish fortification. Russian troops repeatedly wanted to take Vyborg, but it was only Peter I who succeeded in 1710. The Swedes made several attempts to retake the city, but to no avail. The city remained behind Russia.</p>

                    <p class="viborg_title">KARELIA</p>
                    <div class="viborg_text">
                        <p>Karelia is one big nature reserve and a country of lakes. The region borders Finland, and part of Karelia has long been Finnish territory. In the 7th century AD, according to Swedish and Norwegian legends and chronicles, the lands of modern Karelia were called the rich country of Kirjalabotnar. She has always been a coveted prey for the Vikings.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px ;">Only a tenth of the territory of Karelia is suitable for living. The rest is wild forests, lakes, rivers, swamps. Moreover, in terms of the ratio of the area of lakes to the total area, this is the most lake region in the world. There is the largest body of water in Europe (Lake Ladoga) and a lake formed as a result of a meteorite fall (Zayachye, or Janisjärvi). If you add up all the Karelian rivers in length, you can wrap the Earth twice with them.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px ;">This is an amazing region. White nights in summer and northern lights in winter, Karelian birch without annual rings and the legendary healing stone shungite, petroglyphs that are older than the Egyptian pyramids, the first Russian resort and the world's only apple orchard near the Arctic Circle (in Valaam).</p>

                    <p class="viborg_title">MURMANSK</p>
                    <div class="viborg_text">
                        <p>Located on the hills of the Kola Bay, Murmansk is the largest city in the world beyond the Arctic circle. In summer, it is a polar day here — the sun shines 24 hours a day for two months. In winter, the polar night reigns here and you can often see the northern lights over the ice-free sea. The world's first nuclear icebreaker Lenin is moored in the port of Murmansk, at the helm of which you can stand. And local restaurants will delight connoisseurs of gastronomy with seafood and venison.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px ;">Murmansk attracts tourists with excellent transport accessibility, beautiful nature, developed infrastructure and a relatively mild climate. Here you can see all the beauties of the Arctic and the northern lights, go skiing and fishing in the Barents Sea, go on a sea trip along the coast of the Kola Peninsula and watch birds in the Teriberka Nature Park. It is worth going to Murmansk just to taste the freshest seafood, crabs, venison and sweet yagel.</p>
